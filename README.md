# Arithmetic-Calculator
An arithmetic calculator which enforces order of operations via BEDMAS, made using a custom Stack class. I did this in order to consolidate my understanding of the stack data structure and how to design, implement and utilize it efficiently in programming contexts. This project does not use any of the built-in types provided by Java, in order to deepen my understanding of how the stack data structure works.

## Stack Class
This class essentially acts as a skeleton, mimicing the pre-existing Java Stack class. Here, we use dynamically resizable arrays in order to mimic a stack, however, this is done without any built in types, such as ArrayLists.
